# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is WesterosCraft?

WesterosCraft is a large-scale Minecraft project that aims to recreate the world of Westeros from George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, which is also the basis for the popular TV show "Game of Thrones." The project is a community-driven effort, with numerous volunteers working together to meticulously build and design locations from the books and show, such as King's Landing, Winterfell, and The Wall.

## Can I download the map?

Not until the map is finished. Certain individual downloads may be put up in the future.

## When will the map be finished?

When its done.  Keep an eye on our [Project Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sOtwUZZW2ct1vQ-dAhQXdiwZ4U9TGg-T-CSQv-6vgWE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and log in occasionaly to see our progress!

## Wheres Essos?

While the immediate goal is to finish Westeros, Essos and its creation is already planned.

## How do I apply to build?

Our application guidelines are detailed on our website [here](https://westeroscraft.com/docs/getting-started/apply-to-build).

## What can I do on the server?

If you are a new visitor, you are free to explore the server and it's builds at your leisure. Please check our Server Rules before going online. Unfortunately you will not be able to build until you have put in an application on our forums and been accepted. For more info about this, check out our Basic Building Guide for Applicants before making an application.

## How do I visit a location?

If you know the name of the place you want to visit, type /warp [location] in the chat. Replace [location] with the name of your destination. For example, to warp to King's Landing type /warp kingslanding in chat. If you don't know the name or you are unsure about the spelling you are welcome to ask. A great way to explore new locations is /warp map in game. To see all of our warps in one place, or just to check out the scale of our map, check out our dynamic map . You can focus it on your character to follow your journey through Westeros, as well as enable and disable different layers of information, such as player names or warps (this can be useful to find out where you are - but beware, there is a lot of warps! Enabling this layer while zoomed out may cause your browser to freeze or crash.)

## How big is the map?

The map is currently several dozen gigs in file size. If you're wondering about the dimensions, it's roughly 22,000 x 59,000 blocks. About 1298 sq km / 501.14 sq mi, roughly the size of Los Angeles.

## Is the server based on books or tv show?

Our builds are based on the books, but we do use the HBO show as inspiration occasionally.

## What book is the server set in?

The server is set on 3/3/299 according to this timeline. This puts us at the start of A Clash of Kings, specifically the first Davos chapter. Explore with caution, WesterosCraft has destinations that contain spoilers for both the show and the book.

## Where's the Moon Door?

It's there - in the books, the door is set in the wall at the Eyrie, not a hole in the floor.
