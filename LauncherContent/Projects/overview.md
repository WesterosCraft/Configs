Quick overview on non-region sheets:
The Overview tab will be the "landing page" of the sheet and features links to handy resources, as well as a short list of recently completed builds (it grabs the top ten most recent from the Database sheet sorted by Finish Date). It also features the upcoming Project Queue. Always open to suggestions on how best to use this page, its goal is to really get builders the information they need to apply quickly and easily.

The Database sheet is simply all the other region sheets compiled into one - its a many-to-one relationship. Its used to make stats and graphs for the Dashboard page and also sort everything at once via the slicers.

The Dashboard contains stats and stuff on the project, including things like every House we have completed, builders and the number of projects they've completed, things like that

The Region sheets are the bread and butter of the project and what needs the most work. Most of the region sheet stuff is explained on the Guide tab
