# Community Rules

**Read this page carefully!**

**Breaking any of the rules below might result in a temporary or permanent ban of your account from the server, forums, and Discord.**

## The Golden Rule

Don't be an asshole. Treat others as you would like to be treated.

## The rest of the rules

### Rules for Gameplay

1. **No griefing.** Guests to the server do not have permission to build, but any attempts to grief the server will result in a ban. If you are a builder, we will consider griefing as a breach of trust, and will result in a ban. This includes altering or destroying the work of others without properly consulting them, or explicit permission from the moderating team.

2. **No items.** Things that create entities on our server (items, minecarts, boats, arrows, snowballs, crows, cows etc.) can really add up and start causing lag. In the same vein, don't place large quantities of paintings, star charts, redstone or interactive blocks or similar.

3. **Do not abuse bugs** you may find. Let a moderator or admin know. As for bugs with textures please report those to the [Texturepack Megathread](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/westeroscraft-texture-pack-megathread.34/), after checking back with others that it is not only a glitch on your end.

4. **Do not impersonate** admins, mods or other users. Breaking this rule is an instant ban, with a small chance of an appeal being approved.

5. **Give constructive feedback**. Focus on how to improve the outcome, make suggestions, but accept that the other person might have their own view. Even negative feedback can be constructive if phrased appropriately. Refer to the [Community Charter](https://westeroscraft.com/docs/rules-and-guidelines/westeroscraft-community-charter) section on feedback.

6. **Try to stay active and involved** with the community. Check the Discord and forums regularly in case anyone is trying to reach out to you! As a builder, if you have **been absent for more than a year** you may be asked to reapply for builder status.

### Rules for In-Game Chat and Discord

1. **No racist, sexist, homophobic or any other prejudiced comments or insults**. If you think you probably shouldn't say something, then don't.

2. **Show and book spoilers are permitted in discussion**. Press F1 to hide chat if you want to avoid spoilers. Intentionally spoiling someone's experience is a ban worthy offense.

3. **No spamming the chat**. This includes, but is not limited to: sending a lot of messages, talking in all caps, and spamming characters (i.e. AAAAAAAAAAAAA).No advertising other servers or trying to recruit players on our server.

### Consequences

Our rules are visible both on the wiki and in the spawn town. If you have any questions, please contact a moderator and they will help you out. Here's what could happen if you start breaking rules.

**Warning**. A moderator may warn you to stop what you are doing. Depending on the severity of your actions, you may receive no prior warning at all.

**Kick**. You will be kicked from the server.

**Mute**. A mod can chose to mute your chat output for an extended amount of time, so that no one can read what you write.

**Temporary Ban**. This is a ban with a certain time limit, frequently 24 or 48 hours. You have not followed the rules. You have not listened to the warnings and instructions. Take some time away and think about what it means to be a part of our community.

**Extended Ban**. This is a ban with an indefinite time period. After some time has passed, usually a few months or more, you are allowed to appeal your ban to show that you have changed and that you still belong on the server.

**Demotion**. As a builder, you managed to break our trust by abusing the Builder rights that have been given to you. This includes but is not limited to, building unapproved easter eggs, altering other players builds without consent, starting a project without mod approval. All of these could also be considered as griefing depending on the situation or frequency which will lead to a Permanent Ban.

**Permanent Ban**. Self explanatory.

Our rules are about following the [spirit of the law, not the letter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_the_law). For visiting Guests there is a lower tolerance for offenses, often merely a single warning followed by a ban. Keep that in mind when visiting us.

### Appeals

If you wish to challenge a ban, mute or demotion, you may post an appeal on our [Appeal Subforum.](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/forum/ban-mute-demotion-appeals.33/)
