New users can contribute to these projects, adding their unique touch to collaborative projects that contribute to the overall aesthetic of the server.
4. **Share Creations on Discord or Social Media**
   - Players can share screenshots or videos of their creations on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pBS5TH4), social media channels (be sure to tag us!), or designated community spaces. This allows them to receive feedback, connect with other players, and showcase their work to a wider audience.
